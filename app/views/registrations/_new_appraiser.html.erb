            While there are no limitations to the types of property that can be appraised online IF the property is no longer available such as would be the case if the property had been destroyed in a fire or had been stolen, there are practical limitations to the use of online appraisals for items that ARE STILL available for inspection. ...

            <b> Sample Appraisal Report Form </b>
          </p>

          <p>
            The appraisal report form consists of a series of dialog boxes. Some are auto-filled from input provided by the client. Some are grayed out which means that you cannot edit the content. Others are not grayed out. These are fields you are free to edit and/or add information.

          <ul>

            <br>
            <li>
              If it is a <b>"Full"</b> appraisal, the client has paid extra, so be sure to provide an extensive narrative in the COMMENT dialog box.

          </p>

          <p>
            Appraisers/experts are paid on the 15th of the month for completed appraisals. Email

            <b> Going on vacation? </b>
          </p>

          <p>
            If you will not be available to accept appraisal requests there is nothing you need do. Simply stop accepting assignments. They will be claimed by other appraisers.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b> Avoid conflict of interest </b>
          </p>

          <p>
            Appraisers must at all times be independent, impartial, must not be an advocate and must not have a personal interest in the property being appraised. To this end, appraisers may not purchase items they appraise. Please review ValueThisNow.com's

            <b> Appraiser profile </b>
          </p>

          <p>
            The "Appraiser Profile" feature of ValueThisNow.com will include appraiser information such as the appraiser's name, photo, societal affiliations and professional profile.

          <p>
            <b>  Completion time </b>
          </p>

          <p>
            For appraisals, our goal is that the client receive their appraisal report within 48 hours. The time begins with the initial submission of the assignment request or runs from the time the assignment is re-submitted with the additional information requested by the appraiser.
